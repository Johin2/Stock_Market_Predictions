This project is designed to use machine learning models to make predictions about the stock market. The goal of this project is to analyze historical stock market data and use it to create models that can accurately predict future market trends.

The data used in this project comes from public stock market data sources, such as Yahoo Finance. The data includes information about RELIANCE.NSE, such as the opening price, closing price, high price, low price

The project uses a SVC model to make predictions about future stock market trends

The data is first preprocessed to clean and normalize it for training. Then, the data is split into training and testing sets to prevent overfitting. The models are then trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can run the project by executing the main.py file.
